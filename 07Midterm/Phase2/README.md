# Burns Midterm

## Phase 2

- Created the window in Processing using the example from the class repository.

- Started drawing shapes using the "draw" function as demonstrated on the repository.

*PROBLEM* The first ellipse is in the wrong place.

*SOLUTION* I realised that the x & y values are the centre-point of the ellipse, not the top left point.

- Added colour where appropriate by changing the "fill" function for each shape. Used a colour-finder tool to identify the correct values for each shape.

*PROBLEM* The rectangle is in the wrong place.

*SOLUTION* Turns out that for rectangles, the x & y co-ordinates DO represent the top-left co-ordinates.

- I tweaked some of the dimensions from the graph paper sketch to better emulate the original logo.
