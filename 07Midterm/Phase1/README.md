# Burns Midterm

## Phase 1

- I decided to try to recreate a basic version of the Incredibles logo. This shape, in my variation, is made up of two circles, two ellipses, a rectangle and a triangle

- I'm not very good at hand-drawing so this sketch took much longer than it should have. The bug here is poor fine motor skills.
