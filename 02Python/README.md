# Python Reading

## Chapter 1: The Way of the Program

### What I Knew (WIK)

Errors in coding are called "bugs" (because they ate the punchcards, right?) and there are three types: syntax, runtime and semantic.

### Brand New Information (BNI)

The difference between natural and formal languages; English and chemical formulae, respectively, for example. Also, the idea that syntax is made up of "tokens" (the symbols used) and "structure" (the order in which those symbols are permitted to be written).

## Chapter 3: Functions

### WIK

The int() function takes any number and converts it to an integer, not by rounding but by removing anything after the decimal point.

### BNI

An argument is a particular value assigned to a parameter within a function. For example, if the function was sum(a+b) and the input was sum(4+7), 4 and 7 would both be arguments.
Also, function calls seem to be (I think) the only thing that alters the flow of execution. If another function is called within that first function call, Python jumps to that and executes all statements there before continuing its flow.

## Chapter 5: Conditionals and Recursion

### WIK

Boolean expressions can only be either true or false. Also, there are three logical operators: and, or & not.

### BNI

It is possible to use a "pass" statement as a placeholder to return to if you know you need a conditional operator but haven't written it yet.
"elif" is short for "else if" and enables you to write a chain of conditions.

### Chapter 10: Lists

## WIK

Not very much... I knew what a list is, I suppose, but that's about it!

## BNI

Lists can be created using square brackets. These lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after being created. Lists work very differently to strings. For example, creating two identical lists and calling them "a" and "b" will not cause a=b, but doing that with strings instead *will* cause a=b.
