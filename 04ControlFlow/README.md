# Pyramid / FizzBuzz

## Pyramid

### What I Did

- Tested the "square" example from the homework assignment to understand the concept

- First I'm trying to define the variable "stacks" with this code:

stacks = int(input("How many floors should the pyramid have?"))
if stacks < 0 or stacks > 8:
    print("That's a bad pyramid. Reconsider your actions. Goodbye.")
