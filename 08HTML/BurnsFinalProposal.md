# Final Project Proposal (Tim Burns)

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Before The Flood (definitely subject to change)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

A "Choose Your Own Adventure" text-based game, where the player makes choices that effects the outcome of the story.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

- Midjourney (AI image generation because I am not a qualified visual artist)

- [Fateful Quest Maker](https://github.com/talkol/fateful-quest-maker) as inspiration for the implementation of Python into the game

- Tkinter (or a similar/better GUI-creator) for the visualisation of the game (/RenPy if I decide that's a better choice)

- [Dungeons of Kathallion](https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/tree/main) for more mechanics ideas (how to use more code to allow the user to do more things!)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will incorporate a fully developed non-linear storyline, where the player can work their way to a myriad of endings depending on the decisions they make. There will be many functions defined, with each triggering a particular event in the story. The character will be able to fight monsters, interact with NPCs, and navigate their way through the game world. The software (in its ideal form) will have a fully functioning (and appealing) GUI, with graphics, clickable buttons and more.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Finished story with multiple endings, executable (/fully playable) in a terminal.
- 20 fully coded "scenes" with multiple choices for the player
- Colorised text for aesthetics

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- All of the above, but within a GUI with functioning buttons, audio & visuals
- More sophisticated coding for player interaction; for example, rather than simple yes/no interactions, some NPCs could function more like a chatbot, with a limited ability to "converse" with the player

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Fully realised battle mechanics for improved gameplay

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I will start by drafting the story, and will aim to have this finished by 4/16/24. I will have a "demo" version of the game playable as text on terminal by 4/23/24, having researched how to implement all the necessary functions required for this. After this, I will try to create a GUI (testing both Tkinter and RenPy), and will begin to reprogram the game to work within whichever medium I choose. And the more I think about it, the more likely it is I'll use RenPy. The finished project will be handed in on 5/6/24, before the final class the next day. If I have any time before then, I'll also create a battle mechanism.
